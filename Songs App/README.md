# Songs App

In this app the main purpose is to see how redux works inside react applications.
A list of songs is displayed and the user can click on one and display its data on the 
right side of the screen.

There's only one action which gets dispatched when the user selects a song and updates the
whole state of the application.
There's two reducers, one that had the initial list of songs, and the other that handles the
selected song action.

To make redux work with react a `Provider` is needed at the root of the app, that will work
as a wrapper for the root component and expects a store property which is created using the
`createStore` function from redux, which alse expects all the reducers, that were previously merged
together using the `combineReducers` method.

Each reducer indicates a property of the state, so whenever you wat to access a property inside a
component, you need to make use of the react-redux `connect` function, which exposes the state of the 
app as declared initially on the store.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
